# Project Title

Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) use brain signals to interact with external devices (computers, prosthetics). The pupil is known to dilate (become larger) when participants attend a dark object and constrict (become smaller) when people attend a bright object. It is possible to infer which letter the participant is attending by measuring the change in pupil size.
My master's thesis revolved around exploring a new paradigm exploiting the pupillary light reflex whereby stimuli are presented in rapid succession with the ultimate goal of building a BCI. 

* The script named "analysis_visual_target_detection" demonstrates the data analysis of the first experiment. This analysis explored whether there would be differences in mean pupil size when participants attended a black letter relative to when participants attended a white letter.

* The script named "analysis_2afc" demonstrates the data analysis of the second experiment where the BCI was implemented and tested.

## Acknowledgments

* OpenSesame was used to build and run the experiments (https://github.com/smathot/OpenSesame).
* Pygaze was used to collect the pupil data (https://github.com/smathot/PyGaze).
* Python EyeLinkParser was used to parse the pupil data (https://github.com/smathot/python-eyelinkparser).
* Python Datamatrix was used as a dataframe (https://github.com/smathot/python-datamatrix).
